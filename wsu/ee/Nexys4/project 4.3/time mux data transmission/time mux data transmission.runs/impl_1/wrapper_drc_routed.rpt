-----------------
LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. To allow bitstream creation for designs with combinatorial logic loops (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1]. NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. input_counter/O2_reg_i_1.
Related violations: <none>

LUTLP-1#2 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops.

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

IOCS-1#1 Warning
IOB clock sharing  
IOs Y0, Y2 placed at T8, R8 connects to flops which are clocked by input_counter/O4, input_counter/O3.  Pushing these flops into IOB may cause PAR to fail because the clock route is shared between adjacent (differential pair) IOs.  If there are only two clocks packing them in different BELs might fix the problem, like INST IOB1_flop = BEL FF1 and INST IOB2_flop = BEL FF2.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net input_counter/O2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin input_counter/O1_reg_i_1/O, cell input_counter/O1_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

Gated clock check  
Net input_counter/O3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin input_counter/O2_reg_i_2/O, cell input_counter/O2_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
