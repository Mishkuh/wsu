He loves me, he loves me not
Women are buying "He's Just Not That Into You" by the truckload to
understand their failing relationships. But what if he is into you?

Dec. 6, 2004  |  "I'm reading this 'He's Just Not That Into You' book and I'm surprisingly 
into it," my friend Anna Jane instant-messaged me last
week. Anna Jane, 24 and a fellow reporter, has written about weddings and
engagements for several publications, and this year, inspired by the end
of her own relationship, she created Breakupnews.com, a site that reports
on acrimonious splits. "It's reminding me how not into me Milo was." I was
floored. Anna Jane's ex-boyfriend Milo was, in my opinion, many
things: immature, commitment-phobic and the father of a baby by another
woman on another continent. He was not the right guy. But he was really,
really into Anna Jane. 

I had heard a lot about "He's Just Not That Into You," the ubiquitous
self-help book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, both formerly of HBO's
"Sex and the City." The book was spun off from an episode of the series in
which Carrie's boyfriend Jack Berger tells Miranda that her date didn't
come up to her apartment for a reason no more mysterious than he "just
wasn't that into her." Its message: A strong woman should stop imagining
that the man in her life is treating her shoddily because he is busy,
conflicted or suffering from bad cellular reception. She should move the
hell on. Nip unpromising relationships in the bud by administering a
brief, stinging torture (He does not like me) in place of an endless,
agonizing one (Does he like me?) It's not a bad plan, though the book also
advises women to ratchet down the aggression and reverts to that old Rules
chestnut: Don't call him, he'll call you ... and fulfill your every wish
if he's into you enough. 

Published in September, the book has become a bestseller, with a million
copies in print; a major movie deal is almost final. The tome's
catchphrases ("Don't waste the pretty!") are peppering the female
lexicon. One of my editors recently shrugged in response to a story
pitch: "Eh. I'm just not that into it." My exchange with Anna Jane
suggested that the book's philosophy had penetrated far enough into her
psyche not only to make her reconsider her current dating life, but also
to retroactively recast an old love affair. How could she reduce a
relationship that involved so many heartbreaking complexities down to one
simplistic evaluation? Does the book offer a one-line romantic litmus test
that will free us all from regret and self-recrimination? Or is it just
turning us in increasingly dizzying circles? 

It made my stomach hurt. Were other people's deliciously painful memories
of failed relationships being wiped clean, "Eternal Sunshine"-style, and
replaced with this one-sentence mantra? I sent an e-mail to a handful of
friends asking them about the phenomenon and urging them to pass my query
along to their friends. Within 24 hours my inbox and voice mail were
deluged with messages from women I didn't know. So great was the tidal
wave of fascination with the HJNTIY craze that I received multi-paragraph
missives and had long conversations about the book with women who had not
read it. 

Maria, a 34-year-old New Yorker, was freelancing at Barnes&Noble.com when
she picked up the book out of "morbid curiosity." "I had spent a lot of
time waiting by the phone," she wrote. "This book just tells you to
stop." Kristina Bada, 27, who works in television, said, "It gave me a
huge self-confidence boost ... If someone is truly 'into you,' then they
will go through heaven and earth to spend time with you. They'll go
without sleep, they'll travel if feasible, and they'll do whatever they
have to do so they can see you." Jaime Licht, a 28-year-old San Diego law
student, wrote, "Even my guy friends say it is incredibly accurate and are
worried that college freshmen will read it and frat guys' sex lives will
disappear." Twenty-four-year-old New Yorker Cara Lemieux wrote, "If only I
could regain the hours I have spent overanalyzing e-mails, forwarding them
to my friends, asking what they thought 'he' meant by a certain word or
even the time of the day he sent the e-mail relative to the time 'he' gets
into work ... [it] saves time [and] empowers us by making us realize that
we are not alone in our delusions, and reminds us that we need to stop
behaving like 'he' is the only man on the face of the planet and we are
privileged to have his attention." 

It's the new Atkins: no more pasta, and no more second dates with men who
do not hit Reply promptly enough. By phone, coauthor Tuccillo told me that
after her agent read the book proposal, she dumped her boyfriend. Two
women told me that HJNTIY has become their "bible." And yes, many are
turning the periscope over their shoulders and examining old
relationships. They said that they now see old insults -- forgotten
birthdays and avoidance of family gatherings -- for what they
were: muddled enunciations of something their partners were just too
cowardly to say outright -- that they just weren't that into them. 

"We're upsetting a lot of women," said Tuccillo when I asked her about
this relationship revisionism. But, she said, she is not shocked by how
forcefully the book's mantra is being bandied about. "I thought when I was
typing this book out with Greg that it was going to change the world and
revolutionize dating," she said. "From the moment the idea came into the
world, it seemed to be explosive." 

Cynthia Rockwell, 50, lives in Connecticut and is an associate editor for
Wesleyan [University] Magazine. "I really wish that I had had this book
back in my 20s," wrote Rockwell, who is married to her second
husband. "Oh, it's all so clear in retrospect that I made excuses for guys
who were really a waste of my time." Rockwell recalled a loaf of bread she
baked for her first husband; he didn't eat much of it. "Duh! He just
wasn't that into me if he didn't care to accept a gift I'd made for him
and wasn't concerned about hurting my feelings nor touched that I'd
thought of him," she wrote. Or maybe he just didn't want the bread. No
matter. Rockwell's current husband is very into her. "Soon after we
started dating, he gave me a mug w/ my name on it that he'd found in the
gift-shop at the hospital where he works, clearly showing that while we
were apart going about our day, he'd been thinking of me," she wrote. 

Martha Danly, a 51-year-old management consultant in Point Reyes, Calif.,
who said she does not watch television and reads the Economist and the New
Yorker, had not read the book. But after receiving a forwarded copy of my
message, she looked it up and was so struck by the title that she called
to talk about it. Danly discussed a yearlong post-divorce relationship
with a man who never said he loved her. "If I had read this book I would
have said, 'Let's bring it down to what's really happening; in the end you
are not giving me what I want.'" Danly said it was empowering to a
point. "But why not change the title to 'You're Just Not that Into
Him'?" She added: "I think it's important to ask women: How do we get
hooked over and over again? We don't just make this shit up! Maybe they
should call it 'He Is That Into You but He Cannot Express It.' Or 'I Just
Don't Think He's Able to Be That Into You' or 'He's Just Not Meeting Your
Needs and Therefore You're Just Not Into Him.'" 

Of course, the authors of the book would tell Danly that in her enthusiasm
for their message, she's twisting it back on herself and making
excuses: If he's not expressing it, then he's just not that into
you. Eleven of the book's 16 chapter titles begin with the mantra, each
focusing on specific signs. He is just not that into you if he is not
asking you out, not calling you, not dating you, not having sex with you,
or having sex with someone else; if he only wants to see you when he's
drunk, doesn't want to marry you, is breaking up with you, or has
disappeared on you; if he's married, a selfish jerk, a bully, or a really
big freak. 

I have actually known several really big freaks who were seriously into
me. Be that as it may: HJNTIY's message is loud and clear. There is
something powerful about it, of course: a sense of freedom and self-worth
that comes from stopping a loser relationship in its tracks. But the
book's repeated scolding can also make you feel as if you've been clubbed
repeatedly until you just want to haul your un-loved carcass into
bed. Lucia Smith, a 22-year-old coordinator of a New York pediatric
literacy program, wrote that she "devoured" the book. But she sagely
commented, "They could have written 'Stop wasting your time because you're
clearly worth more than this, because any girl would be worth more than
this' in huge letters and called it a day." 

The upfront self-flagellation factor has made some women wary. One
34-year-old editor at a glossy women's magazine told me she was scared to
read the book. The editor, in the midst of a divorce, is seeing someone
new and said, "I feel like it's going to confirm that the guy I'm dating
right now is not that into me." She added: "I'm afraid I might reevaluate
a lot of my past relationships too and feel bad about myself for staying
in things that weren't that great ... Even with all my experience working
on these kinds of [relationship] stories, I'm afraid I might not be able
to totally resist it mentally." 

It is hard to resist. It plays on our psychological default setting: He
doesn't like me. We women love to swallow hard truths about
ourselves. It's not masochistic, exactly; we just believe that we can take
it and that we must remain vigilant about unpleasant realities. They're
good for us, like soy milk and crunches. Julie Rottenberg and Elisa
Zuritsky, the "Sex and the City" writing team that penned the original
"HJNTIY" episode, argue that the HJNTIY mantra is the opposite of
masochism. "The fact that this has become a phenomenon says there was this
huge level of denial and deluded optimism at work," Rottenberg
said. Zuritsky continued, "What we have been doing to ourselves is
masochistic. This lets you off the hook and cuts off the urge to pull
yourself apart and try to correct the actions that might have caused him
to not be into you." Yes, but only if you can stop that 3 a.m. voice at
"So? He didn't like me. Big deal!" before it drops an octave and murmurs,
"But what if I were skinnier?" 

The important, honest truth in the book makes the frenzy around it all the
more complicated. Because the authors are right, and funny, and
incisive! The no-excuses Behrendt and hard-sell Tuccillo really do
understand men and women and have taken careful stock of their
arguments. Smith, the pediatric literacy coordinator, said that since
reading it, she's been giving her friends, especially the ones "dating
married men or throwing themselves at men who literally said, 'I don't
love you, I'm moving away, I will be dating other people,'" "slightly
meaner" advice. HJNTIY may be the best friend of the best friend: a
necessary manual for all of us who have wanted to take our sisters by the
throat and say: "Shut up! He is never going to call!" 

But sharp as the book is, it also feels -- as Smith says of her new advice
style -- slightly mean. Melinda Arons, a network news producer from
Washington, D.C., and a HJNTIY convert, told me that "to have someone lay
it out for you and be brutally honest about it is a liberating
thing." When I asked her if the message was a little, you know,
soul-killing, she said, "I don't think the authors intended for it to mean
that the person has no love for you or no affection for you. Your
boyfriend could be into you, but are they into you to the point where
you're feeling fulfilled? If you're not, don't feel bad that you have
standards, and move on." 

Ian Kerner, a sex therapist and the author of "She Comes First," will
publish a response to HJNTIY in February. "Be Honest: You're Not That Into
Him Either!" will be released by HarperCollins' ReganBooks. Kerner, 38 and
married, acknowledged the fundamental truth of the original book's
message, but said it's presented in deeply flawed ways. Kerner objects to
Behrendt and Tuccillo's advice about not making phone calls or being
aggressive. "It's like they're telling us to sit back pulling petals off
daisies: He's into me, he's not into me..." 

The book's push for passivity is in fact startling. At one point, Behrendt
suggests that readers write down five good reasons to call the man in
question, then wait an hour and ask themselves, "Do I seem pathetic? Do I
sound like someone who doesn't trust my own innate hotness? Yes, you
do! Now put your dialing finger away, get out of the house, and go find
some fun!" 

"[The book] felt so prescriptive and so goddamn cocky and like such a
simplistic view of life and love," Kerner said. "Any relationship comes
down to two people and backgrounds and context and how they meet, and to
reduce it to a set of rules ... There's something insidious about it
... It is disempowering and a lot like "The Rules," and it sort of leaves
all the power with the guys." As a sex therapist, Kerner said, he finds
that both genders fall "prey to complexities and vulnerabilities, and men
wonder how to be masculine and what to do. So I would hate for a woman to
read that book and think that any guy that doesn't call simply isn't into
her. In some cases it might be true but definitely not always." 

As for the book's resemblance to "The Rules," Tuccillo said, "We were all
obsessed with "The Rules" when it came out because it was telling women to
behave as if they had self-esteem even if they didn't have it. The
criticism of it -- which is valid -- was that the goal seemed to be only
to get a man. And ours is pretty much the opposite. We're saying 'Move on,
sister.' And not just 'Move on so he'll come back.' Actually, 'Just move
on.'" Rottenberg and Zuritsky, the episode writers, maintain that the
beauty of the HJNTIY rule is that they're foolproof. "I don't fear that
someone's going to take this too far, because let's say you decide, I
haven't heard from him all week, so I'm going to move on," Rottenberg
said. "And then he calls. Well, that's great too. Nobody's saying you
should burn him in effigy!" "Or burn yourself in effigy," Zuritsky added. 

All these circular arguments are particularly funny in light of the
simplicity of the original HJNTIY message. "The authors never mention that
the character who originally spoke that line was Jack Berger," observed
Lea, a 31-year-old publishing executive. "He was the utterly self-obsessed
and emotionally immature asshole writer who broke Carrie Bradshaw's heart
with a Post-it note. So he's the wise man? He's the truth teller?" 

Turning to the original text does problematize the whole He's Just Not
That Into You thing. In the episode in question, Miranda indeed finds
liberation in Berger's revelation. But she later applies it to another
guy, who's running off after an Indian meal. It turns out he has
diarrhea. It's part of the joke of the episode: No edict, no matter how
revelatory, can be safely applied to every situation. Sometimes he really
just has to go. 

It's sad to compare that carefully observed truth to Behrendt's Dr. Phil
commando parenting-style response to "Nikki," one of the book's fictional
complainants, who "writes" that her boyfriend doesn't pay attention to her
because he is "totally important and totally busy." "Too busy or important
to ask you out or call you -- what a catch," Behrendt
responds. "Congratulations on your quasi-relationship! It must feel
amazing to know that you've been programmed into the super hot and
important busy guy's cellphone, even if he never uses it to call you. You
must be the envy of every woman he's really dating." Behrendt's tone is a
bracing slap administered by a man to the face of a hysterical woman. 

In Carrie Bradshaw's universe, that's not cool. "Sex and the City" was a
cultural salt lick for a reason. It took old notions of female hysteria
and frivolity and turned them on their heads. It was never about
desperation or insanity, but about what happens when complicated people
collide and each collision forms something new: new pain, new fun, new
sex, new commitments, new disappointments. 

And much as the women I heard from this week kvelled over how the HJNTIY
balm can erase all the painful uncertainty from our lives, I have to
ask: does leaching the complexity of life always bring relief? I don't
think I'm alone is saying that sometimes tortured romantic plotting is
fun. And OK, when it's not fun, at least it reminds us that we can
feel. Making outrageous suppositions and creating fantastical narratives
and theories about what's going on in our love lives can occasionally feed
a very real hunger for something to think about other than our jobs and
ourselves. We all may be superfoxy and unimaginably desirable, as HJNTIY
repeatedly assures us. But sometimes contemplating our wonderful selves
gets old. And that's when we drum up some drama. 

Maybe I'm just weakly reassuring myself that all those rakes out there
really did love me. But I'd like to point out that "Sex and the
City" ended with its heroine, Carrie, in the safely adoring embrace of one
Mr. Big -- a man who spent six seasons illustrating nearly every one of
HJNTIY's chapter headings. He broke up with her (repeatedly), did not
call, married someone else, had sex with other people, didn't want to
marry her, disappeared, was "totally important and busy," and was a
selfish jerk, bully, and really big freak. Big told Carrie in as many
cowardly ways as he could conceive of that he was totally
Just. Not. That. Into. Her. 

And yet...
