Packers crumble under bombardment from Eagles

Philadelphia - Maybe the Green Bay Packers peaked too soon.
Forced to play with emotion week after week after a 1-4 start, the Packers appeared emotionally bankrupt Sunday 
and were beaten to a pulp by the Philadelphia Eagles, 47-17, at Lincoln Financial Field.
"We came out and stunk up the field," tackle Chad Clifton said. "We can't even think about the playoffs right now. 
If we can take care of the remaining four games, maybe we can think about coming back here."
The Packers remained tied with Minnesota atop the NFC North Division with a 7-5 record because the Vikings lost 
in Chicago, 24-14. The Eagles improved to 11-1, all but clinching home-field advantage throughout the NFC 
playoffs.
"We may make the playoffs," quarterback Brett Favre said. "I don't know. It's been an up and down season. But I 
don't think our expectations should change."
According to optimistic nose tackle Grady Jackson, those Super Bowl aspirations continue to burn brightly.
"The better team is still us," Jackson insisted after the defense was flogged for 542 yards, including a record 464 
passing by Donovan McNabb that broke the Packers opponent's record of 448 by St. Louis' Marc Bulger that stood 
for six days. "We didn't play like it today, but we will see them again and it'll be a different outcome."
Mike Kelly, assistant director of pro personnel for the Washington Redskins, didn't necessarily disagree.
"You can't tell me the Eagles are 35 points better than the Packers," Kelly said. "But you can't turn the ball over 
against a good team early. From there, it snowballed.
"I wouldn't paint the world too gray for Green Bay. Green Bay's played too well in the last month. I wouldn't put 
too much stock in this. I have too much respect for Green Bay's coaching staff and Brett Favre to think this could 
happen twice."
At the same time, Kelly was stunned by some of the things he saw from the Packers' defense as coordinated by Bob 
Slowik. He was coach Mike Sherman's hand-picked successor after Sherman fired Ed Donatell, but in two games 
last year against the Eagles the Packers gave up 37 points and 645 yards.
Right from the opening exchanges, Andy Reid's squad was more physical. Favre was knocked down hard by Jevon 
Kearse on the third play. William Henderson caught a pass and was absolutely destroyed by linebacker Jeremiah 
Trotter. The hits kept coming.
But the Eagles weren't equipped to play power football. They had to start their fourth and fifth-best guards, Steve 
Sciullo and Alonzo Ephraim, and after a third-and-1 run by Brian Westbrook was shut down by Na'il Diggs, Reid 
stayed away from Jackson and Cletidus Hunt the rest of the game.
The Packers also rushed McNabb hard, sacking him four times and by Kelly's count knocking him down after eight 
other passes. 
In other words, all Slowik had to do was design a scheme to control the Eagles' passing game, knowing the threat of 
the power run was nil and that he possessed a more-than-adequate pass rush.
To say Slowik failed would be a considerable understatement. 
"It's obviously a major crisis," Slowik told a group of reporters. "I take complete responsibility for the design. 
Ultimately, I'm the man responsible."
Remembering how McNabb ran for 107 yards in the divisional playoffs when Donatell played a lot of man-to-man 
and the defensive backs had their backs turned downfield, Slowik predicated his game plan on corralling McNabb. 
Not once did McNabb run.
"We had a great deal of emphasis trying to keep him in the pocket and then having some zoned-off defense where 
we'd be able to have a vision on him if he did break the pocket," Slowik said. "Our No. 1 concern was McNabb."
To do it, however, Slowik rarely rushed more than four until well into the second half.
"I really think you've got to pressure Don from the time he walks out of the tunnel," said Kelly, a former Eagles 
assistant coach. "They really didn't take advantage of it (the backup guards). Like Pittsburgh does with middle 
linebacker crosses. I didn't see any of that."
Instead, the Packers played a variety of combinations - "We used 90% of our arsenal," Slowik said - and were 
disgraced.
The diminutive Westbrook made the Packers' defense look just plain slow. Diggs kept missing tackles. Safety Mark 
Roman was outclassed on three touchdown passes. Darren Sharper let Westbrook inside him for a 50-yard 
completion 
When Reid split Westbrook wide, the Packers were late recognizing it and adjusting their coverage. That's what 
happened on the first play of the third quarter, when Freddie Mitchell went to the slot inside Westbrook and ran past 
Paris Lenon for a 30-yard completion when the Packers didn't even jam him.
Al Harris wanted to cover Terrell Owens one-on-one more than he did but that probably wouldn't have been the 
answer. It was obvious that Harris can't handle Owens. And it also was obvious that Ahmad Carroll can't handle a 
steady diet of man-to-man coverage without grabbing and holding receivers.
"Andy called a good game today and beat whatever we were trying to do," Sharper said. "They have a lot of 
weapons and they know how to use them properly."
Ahman Green was coming off two sensational games but the inspired Eagles rallied to the ball and rendered the run 
game null and void (50 yards). The enormous surprise was that the Eagles did it without having to commit strong 
safety Michael Lewis to the line.
Thus, coordinator Jim Johnson was able to keep a safety over the top of Javon Walker in various zone coverages. 
With Walker blanketed and the other wideouts failing to beat single coverage on the other side, Favre often had 
nowhere to go with the ball.
"We didn't do anything," quarterbacks coach Darrell Bevell said. "We couldn't get a first down. We didn't run the 
ball. We didn't throw the ball effectively."
Favre rainbowed a long pass to Bubba Franks on the second series that the great Brian Dawkins flagged down for 
the first interception. The second came from the Eagles'15 when cornerback Sheldon Brown came off Donald 
Driver and picked a slightly underthrown pass.
Each of the interceptions led to touchdowns, and then when Favre shockingly was sacked three times in the second 
quarter, the score got completely out of hand.
On two occasions during his post-game briefing, Favre said his team hadn't played with much effort, a point that 
Driver elaborated on.
"It was awful," Driver said. "You get 47 points put on you, what else can you say? Scoreboard told it all."
Yes, it most assuredly did.
The Packers should be expected to regroup and beat Detroit and Jacksonville at home in their Lambeau Field icebox. 
Sherman's teams never lose on the tundra in December.
But the road games in Minnesota and Chicago figure to be brutally contested, and if they get this far the Eagles will 
await.
"Whether it's by a point or 50, a loss is a loss," Sherman said. "We're a lot better football team than this and we will 
be next week."
